# **GemmaFineTuneUI**

**A no-code, user-friendly interface for fine-tuning the Gemma model with your own datasets.**  
Effortlessly personalize your **Gemma** model without any coding, right from your browser.

## üöÄ **Overview**

**GemmaFineTuneUI** is an intuitive web-based tool designed to let anyone fine-tune the **Gemma model** for various NLP tasks. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or hobbyist, this tool enables you to tailor a pre-trained model to your specific needs without writing a single line of code. Simply upload your data, choose your settings, and let the model training begin.

## üõ† **Features**

- **Dataset Upload**: Easily upload datasets in CSV, JSON, or text format directly through the UI.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Automatically format your dataset into the structure required by Hugging Face models, simplifying the data preprocessing.
- **Customize Hyperparameters**: Adjust key training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and training epochs with a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-time Training Monitor**: Track the training process with live updates, including loss values and performance metrics.
- **Download Fine-Tuned Model**: After training, download the fine-tuned model in multiple formats including **GGUF**, **PyTorch**, or **TensorFlow**.
- **Hugging Face Upload**: Seamlessly upload the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face for easy access and sharing.
- **Chatting Inference**: Test your fine-tuned model with an interactive chat-based interface to perform inference and check the results of your fine-tuning.

## üåê **How It Works**

1. **Upload Your Data**: Use the UI to easily upload your dataset in CSV, JSON, or plain text format.
2. **Prepare Dataset**: The tool automatically prepares the dataset to fit Hugging Face‚Äôs required format.
3. **Configure Hyperparameters**: Adjust hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and training epochs via simple sliders and fields.
4. **Start Fine-Tuning**: Click the ‚ÄúStart Training‚Äù button, and the tool will handle the fine-tuning process automatically.
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time updates on the training process, with metrics displayed in the UI.
6. **Download Your Model**: Once training is complete, download your fine-tuned model in **GGUF**, **PyTorch**, or **TensorFlow** format.
7. **Upload to Hugging Face**: Upload your trained model directly to Hugging Face to make it available for others to use.
8. **Test with Chatting Inference**: Use the interactive chat interface to run inference on your fine-tuned model and see how well it performs.
